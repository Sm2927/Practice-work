**for fast I/O**:<br/>

 `cin.tie(NULL);`
              
**Greedy algorithms** :
at every step, we make the choice that looks best at that moment and we get the optimal solution for the entire                             problem.

**Backtracking** :
Go ahead with the approach, check if satisfied. If not, come back. Start with another alternative.

**Skip list**:
an advanced data structure that introduces multi-layers in linked lists for linear traversal and complexity is reduced from O(n) (for simple linked list) to O(sqrt(n)). It can be apllied for sorted linked lists.
